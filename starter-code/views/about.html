  <h1>The Importance of Conversation</h1>
  <p>
    Conversations are key to language development, the exchange of thoughts 
    and ideas and listening to each other. People learn by hearing each other’s 
    thoughts while observing facial and body expressions that show emotions.
    “Face to face conversation is the most human and humanizing thing we do,” 
    says Sherry Turkle in her book Reclaiming Conversation – The Power of Talk 
    in a Digital Age. “Fully present to one another, we learn to listen. It is 
    where we develop the capacity for empathy. It’s where we experience the 
    joy of being heard and of being understood. Conversation advances 
    self-reflection, the conversations with ourselves that are the cornerstone 
    of early development and continue throughout life.” Technology is a part 
    of everyday life, but replacing face-to-face conversation with phone 
    conversation, via texting, emailing, etc., has taken important skills 
    away from children and young adults. In today’s world, there is a “flight 
    from conversation,” as Turkle says. All ages of people cannot do without 
    phones and screens, but a balance is of utmost importance.
